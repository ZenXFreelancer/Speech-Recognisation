#  Basic Speech Recognisation 

This project implements a basic speech recognition system in Python using the speech_recognition library. It allows users to speak into a microphone, captures the audio input, and converts it into text using speech recognition algorithms.

What it Does:

Captures audio input from the microphone.
Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize speech patterns.
Converts the recognized speech into text.
Outputs the transcribed text to the console.
Who it's For:

Developers: Developers interested in integrating speech recognition functionality into their Python applications or projects.
Students and Educators: Those learning about natural language processing, audio signal processing, or machine learning may find this project educational and practical for experimentation and learning.
Users with Accessibility Needs: Individuals with disabilities or those who prefer voice-based interaction can benefit from applications that incorporate speech recognition technology.
Voice Interface Enthusiasts: Hobbyists and enthusiasts exploring voice-controlled interfaces or voice-based applications can use this project as a foundation for experimentation and building more advanced systems.
